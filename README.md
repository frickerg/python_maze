This project addresses the problem of finding a path in a maze from a point 'A' to a point 'B'.

For this project a maze is contained in a text file as illustrated below. The '*' represent the walls of the maze. The four diection 'N' (north), 'S' (south), 'W' (west), and 'E' (east) are the four directions to represent a path from the initial point 'A' to the final point 'B'.

Initial point 'A' is always locate in the top-left corner and the final point 'B' in the bottom-right corner.
